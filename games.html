        <h2><center>Which Games?</center></h2>
        <p>I play a variety of games! Stardew Valley, Hearthstone, Animal Crossing, Slay The Spire, Food Fantasy, Spyro, various Pokemon games, and more~! Although my genres are across the board, the one game I've stuck with for years has been League of Legends. League of Legends is a multiplayer game with five players on one team, and five on the other. With this, there are 5 roles on each team. You have your top laner in the top lane, middle laner in the middle lane, attack damage carry (ADC) in the bottom lane, support with the ADC in the bottom lane, and jungler in the jungler. Each of the roles are played by one person, and they control a certain part of the map. The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy by getting to their "Nexus" in their base, but there are many obstacles called "Towers" and "Inhibitors" in the way.</p>
        <p>Personally, I am a support player, meaning I play with the ADC in the bottom lane. Due to being a support player, as well as a girl, it was hard getting into the game. I would usually keep to myself and not type in the in game chat, never join discord servers to talk to people, and even hid it from my friends because I didn't want them to make fun of me. Eventually, with time, I was able to open up to a few guys from a common server. To this day, I am glad to say we still play, and we have even met in real life multiple times! Between the emotional connection of having close friends to play with, and a fun game you never know the outcome of, this is honestly my top game of all time. You can see my status below!</p>
